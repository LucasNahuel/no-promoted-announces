## Overview

### The objective

Announces marked as "promoted" are likely to show any other while searching on linkedIn. In most cases, they are pertinent to the current search. But sometimes, they are unrelated and repetitive. Being able to ignore the promoted announces will make you able to find best fitted announces faster. And this ones, as they have less exposure, probably will have les candidates, hence less competence and more chances to apply. 

Given this, i made this script that will give you the hability to:

- Filter announces marked as "promoted" from the default linkedin "all filters" tab and hide them dinamically while navigating.
- Revert filter option and unhide the dinamically whithout reloading.

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla Javascript
- Tampermonkey [Tampermonkey homepage](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)

### Continued development

This, along with my other linkedin filter [Spammy announcers blocking](https://github.com/LucasNahuel/linkedin-no-spam-posting-script) could be merged for improved job searching. 
Due to other partners comments, i realize that exclusion search could also help to further improve the searching. I would try to create another filter script for that.
